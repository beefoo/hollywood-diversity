  <h2>A Quick Guide For Making Classifications</h2>

  <h4>Don't judge just based on name, image, or prior assumptions.</h4>

  <p>Names like Casey, Jesse, or Morgan can be either gender. Someone may look white or black, but may have a mixed racial background. Bottom line: don't guess or assume anything!</p>

  <h4>Do some research</h4>

  <p>Links to the person's IMDB Page, Wikipedia page, and Google search are provided on each screen. Sometimes the person's family background is listed in their bio or in articles about them. It is very helpful to add a reference to you the source you find in the <em>Notes</em> field in the form.</p>

  <h4>When in doubt, skip it or say you are unsure</h4>

  <p>Some people are really hard to find information on such as producers or writers. If you are unsure a person's gender, race, or both, just select <em>I am unsure</em> or simply skip them</p>
